# Robotic-Extrusion
The 5-week mini-project of the MAS dfab 22-23 focuses on material properties of 3D printing with PLA extrusion.

We learn and develop fabrication-aware design strategies to explore the plasticity and deposition aspects of this fabrication technique. 

Topics such as on/offline robotic controls and Arduino are introduced in this project.

We develop computational design methods and fabricate 1:1 prototypes, using a custom robotic polymer extrusion setup. 

Through an iterative process of designing and 3D printing the aim is to explore material properties and design approaches in the context of additive digital fabrication process.
